# employee-tracker

The files in this repository contain code for an employee tracker.
Once npm start is run a list of options will be prompted to view all departments, 
view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee 
or update an employee.
Upon selecting the first three choices a table with the correct information will be 
displayed in your terminaland as for the last three more questions will be prompted 
for you to fill out and once that is done a table with the updated information will
appear in your terminal.
The schema and seeds files should be sourced in mysql before running an npm start in 
the server
